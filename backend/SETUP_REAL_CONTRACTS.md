# Backend Setup Guide - Real Contract Integration

This guide explains how to set up the backend to make **real on-chain transactions** for insurance payouts.

## Prerequisites

1. **Go 1.19+** installed
2. **PostgreSQL** database running
3. **Deployed contracts** on a testnet (Sepolia recommended)
4. **Oracle wallet** with some testnet ETH for gas

## Step 1: Deploy Contracts

First, deploy the contracts to get the addresses:

```bash
cd ../contracts
npm install
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

**Save the output:**
- MockUSDT address: `0x...`
- InsurancePool address: `0x...`
- Deployer/Oracle address: `0x...`

## Step 2: Configure Backend

Edit `backend/config.yaml`:

```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  dbname: spikeshield

rpc:
  url: https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
  contract_address: "0xYourInsurancePoolAddress"
  private_key: "your_private_key_without_0x_prefix"

detector:
  threshold_percent: 10.0
  window_minutes: 5

chainlink:
  btc_usd_feed: "0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43"
  update_interval: 60

mode: replay  # or 'live'
```

### Important Configuration Notes

#### RPC URL
- Get free API key from [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- Sepolia testnet recommended for testing

#### Contract Address
- Use the **InsurancePool** contract address from deployment
- NOT the USDT address

#### Private Key
- **MUST be the oracle address** set in the contract
- Remove the `0x` prefix
- Example: If your key is `0xabc123...`, use `abc123...`
- ⚠️ **NEVER commit this to git!** Use environment variables in production

#### Verifying Oracle Address

The backend will verify on startup that your private key matches the contract's oracle:

```bash
✅ Connected to InsurancePool contract at 0x123...
✅ Oracle address: 0x742d35Cc...
```

If you see an error:
```
❌ private key does not match contract oracle
```

Then either:
1. Use the correct private key (the one that deployed the contract)
2. Or call `setOracle(newAddress)` on the contract to change it

## Step 3: Fund the Oracle Wallet

The oracle needs ETH for gas fees:

```bash
# Get testnet ETH from Sepolia faucet
# https://sepoliafaucet.com/
# https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia

# Send 0.1 - 0.5 ETH to your oracle address
```

## Step 4: Fund the Insurance Pool

The pool needs USDT to pay out claims:

```bash
# Using Hardhat console
cd ../contracts
npx hardhat console --network sepolia

# Mint USDT to your address
const USDT = await ethers.getContractAt("MockUSDT", "0xYourUSDTAddress");
await USDT.mint("0xYourAddress", ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6));

# Approve and fund the pool
await USDT.approve("0xInsurancePoolAddress", ethers.parseUnits("5000", 6));
const Pool = await ethers.getContractAt("InsurancePool", "0xPoolAddress");
await Pool.fundPool(ethers.parseUnits("5000", 6));

# Verify pool balance
await Pool.getPoolBalance(); // Should show 5000 USDT (in 6 decimals)
```

## Step 5: Install Go Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
go mod tidy
```

The key dependency is:
```go
github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.13.0 // For contract interaction
```

## Step 6: Run the Backend

```bash
# Set up database
docker exec -i spikeshield-db psql -U postgres -d spikeshield < db/schema.sql

# Run the service
go run main.go
```

```

## Step 7: Test the Integration

### 1. Create a Test Policy (from frontend or Hardhat)

```javascript
// Using Hardhat console
const USDT = await ethers.getContractAt("MockUSDT", "0xUSDTAddress");
const Pool = await ethers.getContractAt("InsurancePool", "0xPoolAddress");

// Mint and approve USDT
await USDT.mint(await signer.getAddress(), ethers.parseUnits("100", 6));
await USDT.approve(Pool.target, ethers.parseUnits("10", 6));

// Buy insurance
await Pool.buyInsurance();

// Verify policy
const count = await Pool.getUserPoliciesCount(await signer.getAddress());
console.log("Total policies:", count.toString());
```

### 2. Trigger Backend Detection

Backend will automatically detect spikes from the CSV data in replay mode, or from live Chainlink feeds in live mode.

### 3. Verify Payout

Check on Etherscan (Sepolia):
- Navigate to `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xYourPoolAddress`
- Look for `executePayout` transactions
- Verify USDT transfers to policy holders

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Only oracle can execute payout"

**Cause:** Private key doesn't match the contract's oracle address

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check oracle address in contract
cast call 0xPoolAddress "oracle()(address)" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Check address from your private key
cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# If different, update oracle in contract (as owner)
cast send 0xPoolAddress "setOracle(address)" 0xNewOracleAddress --private-key $OWNER_KEY
```

### Error: "Insufficient pool balance"

**Cause:** Pool doesn't have enough USDT

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fund the pool (see Step 4)
```

### Error: "Transaction underpriced"

**Cause:** Gas price too low

**Solution:** Backend auto-suggests gas price, but you can increase the multiplier:
```go
// In payout.go
gasPrice = new(big.Int).Mul(gasPrice, big.NewInt(120)) // 20% higher
gasPrice = new(big.Int).Div(gasPrice, big.NewInt(100))
```

### Error: "Failed to wait for transaction"

**Cause:** Network congestion or transaction reverted

**Solution:**
- Check transaction on Etherscan
- Increase gas limit if out-of-gas
- Check if policy is valid (not expired, not already claimed)

## Production Considerations

### Security

1. **Never commit private keys** to version control
2. Use environment variables:
   ```bash
   export ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_key"
   export RPC_URL="your_rpc_url"
   ```
3. Use secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
4. Restrict oracle wallet permissions (separate from owner wallet)

### Monitoring

1. Monitor oracle wallet ETH balance
2. Monitor pool USDT balance
3. Set up alerts for failed transactions
4. Log all payout attempts

### Gas Optimization

1. Batch payouts if possible
2. Monitor gas prices and delay non-urgent transactions
3. Use EIP-1559 gas pricing for better estimates

### Scaling

1. Use archive node for historical queries
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Queue system for high transaction volume
4. Multiple oracle wallets for load distribution
